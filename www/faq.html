				  <b>Are these real questions?</b>
				  <p>
						Why, yes, actually!
					</p>

				  <b>How does DEAP differ from other astronomical data reduction packages, such as
					<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf">PyRAF?</a></b>
					<p>
					  DEAP is not a full data reduction package and does not try to compete
						with projects such as PyRAF.  It is true that DEAP does include some
						data reduction features, such as statistics and fitting, but these
						are really more of a convenience than anything else.  Most data reduction
						you would do "in DEAP" is really by means of the integrated
						<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> command line, through
						which you can access other numerical packages.
					</p>
					<p>
					  That said, most existing data reduction packages are command line
						driven (PyRAF is just one example), and even though they may supply
						commands to display a plot, they generally lack a mechanism for
						interactive data exploration and manipulation.  DEAP seeks to complement
						such packages by providing interactive, graphical data display and
						editing in an easy-to-integrate, modular form.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <b>How does DEAP differ from other plotting packages?</b>
					<p>
					  It is true that there are many other plotting packages available,
						each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Some, for example,
						are very good at producing high-quality scientific graphics, but
						can be weak in the area of user interactivity.  Many others provide
						good support for interactive data display and exploration, but
						don't produce publication quality plots.  We are not aware of any
						other easily integrable tools that provide good support for
						interactive data editing.
					</p>
					<p>
					  DEAP strives to provide very good data editing tools and good data
						exploration tools (there are better...) while still producing
						publishable scientific plots.  And it does all this with a highly
						modular package that easily integrates with or interoperates with
						other scientific data reduction tools.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <b>What is "data reduction"?</b>
					<p>
					  The process of getting from raw scientific data to publishable science.
