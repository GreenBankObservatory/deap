        Astronomers from around the world come to the
				<a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/">Green Bank</a>
				site of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
				(<a href="http://www.nrao.edu/">NRAO</a>) to perform radio
        astronomy observations with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope
				(<a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/GBT/">GBT</a>).
				Thus, there is a pressing need for a generic data
        display and analysis toolkit that will provide radio astronomers with a versatile mechanism for viewing and interpreting their
        observation data. Astronomers refer to the conversion of raw radio astronomy data into publishable science as data reduction.
        Data reduction is an interactive, highly iterative process of viewing the data in detail, editing it (data flagging), and
        analyzing it (data fitting). Currently, there are no existing tools that accommodate data viewing, data flagging, and data
        fitting within the same application. There are good tools for producing publication quality plots (PGPlot), for producing
        interactive read-only plots (tkplot or qwt), and for doing data analysis (numeric, gsl). However, no existing free tools solidly
        combine all these features, and no existing tools provide quality interactive graphical data editing. The creation of a single
        application that marries these needs is the motivation for Data Extraction and Analysis Program, or DEAP. Even though DEAP has
        been developed with the data reduction needs of the NRAO in mind, all assumptions regarding the nature of the data entered into
        the program were kept at a minimum. This means that DEAP is intended to be useful for viewing, flagging, and fitting many types
        of data, not just astronomical data. Hence, DEAP will be made available as an Open Source product via Source Forge at
        <a href="http://deap.sourceforge.net/">http://deap.sourceforge.net/</a>.

        DEAP is written in Python and presents two user interfaces - a command line window and a plot window. The GUI portion of DEAP
        utilizes wxPython and features a custom widget, created by the NRAO, that integrates PGPlot into wxWindows. PGPlot is a
        C-callable, device-independent graphics package for making simple scientific graphs and has been used in radio astronomy software
        for many years to produce publication-quality plots (see
				<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/">http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/</a>
				for more information regarding PGPlot). The following is a summary of DEAP’s current features:
		  </p>
			
			<ul>
        <li>Interactive, multicolor XY plotting with zooming, error bars, and data flagging capabilities</li>
        <li>XY plots allow choice of line type (including no line), choice of marker type for data point representation and auto-scaling</li>
        <li>Creation of titles, axes labels, and annotations</li>
        <li>Plotting of multiple data sets on the same plot</li>
        <li>Saving/Retrieving of plots and plot information from binary files</li>
        <li>Exporting of plots to a variety of graphical formats: BMP, GIF, Postscript, color Postscript</li>
        <li>Data analysis operations available for data sets include calculation of the mean, calculation of the variance, Gaussian fitting, linear fitting, and polynomial fitting</li>
        <li>Command line (allowing full access to numeric python)</li>
        <li>User interactive plot window</li>
			</ul>

		  <p>
        Perhaps DEAP's features can be better explained by highlighting some of the features above. XY data sets are entered into DEAP
        via the command line window. The X data and Y data are simply lists of numbers. In fact, all data entered into DEAP and extracted
        from DEAP are formatted as lists at the command line. The command line window for DEAP is the Python command line plus a set of
        functions through which the user may interact with DEAP. For example, the user may add a new XY plot to DEAP via the AddXYPlot
        command that accepts two arguments - a list of x data and a list of y data. The command line enables DEAP commands to be executed
        one at a time or as scripts (via Python's execfile function). Many commands that are available via the command line are also
        available via drop-down menus or toolbar items in the plot window. One feature of note is the integration of both the command
        line window and the plot window, meaning that command issued through one window are reflected both in DEAP and in the other
        window.
		  </p>

		  <p>
        The plot window is focused on handling user interactions with the XY data sets. These interactions include zooming and flagging.
        Flagging refers to associating an integer value with a data point. By default, all data points in an XY data set are flagged with
        a value of 0. The user associates flag values with data points by lassoing them with the mouse. Because the flag values are
        simply integers, the user is free to associate any meaning to the flag values that he/she desires. Flagging is important in
        working with radio astronomy data because it is an important means of highlighting data contaminated with radio frequency
        interference or RFI.

        DEAP currently runs on Linux and Windows, but plans are underway to allow its use on Mac Os X.
