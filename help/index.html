<h2><a name="CommandLine">DEAP Command Line</a>
</h2>
<p>
The command line is a slightly modified version of the wxPython shell, which
is a Python interpreter.  The command line is an interactive vehicle for
plotting and anything else that you desire.  All installed Python modules are
available from the command line.  Additionally, the command line is augmented
with several functions mentioned below to support plotting.  
</p>
<p>
More information about Python and its syntax is available at the
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python website</A>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="clear"></a><b>draw()</b>
<ul>
    Clears the plotting canvas.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="draw"></a><b>draw()</b>
<ul>
    Generates a redraw event, which refreshes the plot.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="export"></a><b>export(file)</b>
<ul>
    Allows the user to save the figure displayed in the plotting panel to a
    file.  Supported graphical formats are: Encapsulated Postscript and PNG.
    This functionality is also available via File->Export and via the toolbar.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="freeze"></a><b>freeze(message = None)</b>
<ul>
    Freezes further processing of the command line until the
    application receives an unfreeze via the GUI. The message
    argument, when supplied, is a string which is translated into
    a message dialog that is displayed to the user reminding him/her
    that a "freeze" command has been issued. If the message string 
    is not supplied, no dialog is displayed before the command line
    is frozen.
    <pre>
    Eg.
    freeze()             # Freezes the command line - no message dialog
    freeze("my message") # Freezes the command line & displays dialog
                         # containing the string, "my message"
    </pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="get_data"></a><b>get_data(index = -1)</b>
<ul>
    Returns either data for the indicated subplot or a list of all 
    data plotted on the graph.  Subplots are ordered starting with 
    Y1 columns and continuing with Y2 columns.<br />
    Data for each subplot is returned in a list like:
    <pre>
    [[x1, x2, ..., xN], [y2, y2, ..., yN]]
    </pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="get_figure"></a><b>get_figure()</b>
<ul>
    Returns the matplotlib figure object associated with the plotting area. 
    The matplotlib figure is the entry point for all plotting functionality.  
    To learn more about the plotting capabilities of matplotlib, visit the
    <A HREF="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib website</A>.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="get_subplot"></a><b>get_subplot(index = None)</b>
<ul>
    Returns either the indicated subplot object or a list of all subplot
    object contained in the figure object (when the index is not 
    specified).  The index argument is an integer which represents the
    subplot number within the figure object.  Note that subplot indexing
    begins at zero.

    <pre>
    Eg.
    get_subplot()   # Return a list of all subplot objects
    get_subplot(0)  # Returns the first subplot object
    </pre>

    To learn more about the plotting capabilities of matplotlib, visit the
    <A HREF="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib website</A>.
    subplot objects have all the properties of axes objects.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="hold"></a><b>hold(b = None)</b>
<ul>
    Set the hold state.  If hold is None (default), toggle the
    hold state.  Else set the hold state to boolean value b.
    This controls both the matplotlib figure object and the GUI window.
    <pre>
    Eg.
    hold()      # toggle hold
    hold(True)  # hold is on
    hold(False) # hold is off
    </pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="open_file"></a><b>open_file(file)</b>
<ul>
    Opens a previously saved session or user-created file containing DEAP 
    commands.  file is a string containing the path to the desired file.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="redo"></a><b>redo()</b>
<ul>
    Redoes the last command typed in the interactive shell.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="set_scale"></a><b>set_scale(index = 0, xlim = None, ylim = None)</b>
<ul>
    Rescale axes of given subplot to limits (xmin, xmax) and (ymin, ymax).
    If a set of limits is not given, it is set to autoscale.<br />
    Returns the current limits.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="undo"></a><b>undo()</b>
<ul>
    Undoes the last command typed in the interactive shell.
</ul>
</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="GUISave"></a><img src="Save.bmp"><b>Save</b>
<ul>
    Displays the save file dialog if a file has not
    been previously opened or saved and allows the user to save the current
    session to a new .txt file.  If a file has been previously opened or
    saved, that file is automatically overwritten with the current
    command line history. This functionality is also available via File->Save.
</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="GUIPrint"></a><img src="Print.bmp"><b>Print</b>
<ul>
    Displays the print dialog and allows the user
    to print the figure displayed in the plotting panel.  This functionality

    point in a script to suspend further processing of script commands and
    allow the user to view/interact with the plot that has been created to
    that point.  The Unfreeze button is invoked via the toolbar to resume
    operation. This functionality is also available via File->Unfreeze.
</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="GUIUndo"></a><img src="Undo.bmp"><b>Undo</b>
<ul>
    Undoes your last command.  If there are no commands to undo,

    Undo toolbar button will result in no action. This functionality is
    also available via Edit->Undo.
</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="GUIRedo"></a><img src="Redo.bmp"><b>Redo</b>

    to focus in/out among the available subplots.  Left-clicking the mouse
    brings a subplot into focus (hiding the other subplots).  Right-clicking 
    the mouse on the focused plot will show all subplots.  If there is only one
    subplot, the info tool simply displays the mouse xy coordinates.
    This functionality is also available via Tools->Info.
</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="GUIZoom"></a><img src="ZoomTool.bmp"><b>Zoom Tool</b>
<ul>
    Selecting the zoom tool allows the user to use the mouse pointer

    the left button down will pan around the subplot.  Right-clicking restores
    the original view.  This functionality is also available via Tools->Pan.
</ul>
</p>
<p><a name="GUIGrid"></a><img src="Grid.bmp"><b>Grid Tool</b>

    Selecting the plot edit tool allows the user to edit plot labels, colors,
    and title.  Clicking on "Advanced Options" brings up an additional dialog
    which contains options for transparency, legend placement, and ordering of
    plots.<br />
    Colors may be entered as hex codes or selected by clicking on the colored
    button to the right of the text field.  Plots can only be reordered within
    their subplot - i.e., Y1 lines will always be below Y2 lines.  Legend
    location can be specified with simple strings (e.g., "upper right") or
    coordinates 0-1 along the plot edges.  If a string is chosen it will be
    used in place of any coordinates.<br />
    This functionality is also available via Tools->Edit Plot.
</ul>
</p>
